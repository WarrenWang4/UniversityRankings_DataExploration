# UniversityRankings_DataExploration

Ranking Universities is difficult and often that not gets political and controversial. Just like any other rankings, ranking Universities have some rooted bias in them. Therefore, is there a way to explore these ranking data to uncover bias? Is there an algorithm that can help normalize the data to reduce bias in Univeristy Rankings? Through this data exploration project, we will find out.

For this project I will be using the Times, Shanghai and Center for World University rankings data to do my analysis. The datasets are provided through Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings.
